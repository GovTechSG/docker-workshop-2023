# Exercise 1.3: Running More Nginx
In this exercise, you will launch two Nginx running simultaneously. This exercise does not have a guide.

## Requirements
- You will launch two Nginx Servers that will run at the same time
- They need not run at port 80, but they both have to be accessible at the same time
- One of the Nginx Servers must output something other than "Welcome to nginx!"

Have Fun!

## Cleanup
Don't leave any dangling containers! Note that you have to remove containers even after stopping them! To clean up all stopped containers, run `docker container prune -f`.
